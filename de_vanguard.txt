Description
-----
Cafe first post and cafe vanguard are located in the same building in the historic part of the city. Terrorists have placed 2 bombs in the guise of suitcases.
This was done while masquerading as pub hopping gentleman. The counter-terrorist got wind of this and came to disarm the bombs. This is the last try of the terrorists to blow up the whole place to kingdom come.

Notes
-----
Sorry for the cheesy description.
This map was made in one month. After the contest, all assets including the rmf will be released as a open source project.

This is probably my last endeavor as a mapper. Please rate my map and tell me if I am missing something.
